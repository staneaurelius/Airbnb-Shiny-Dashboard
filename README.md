# Airbnb Shiny Dashboard

This project is created as one of the Algoritma Academy Data Visualization Specialization's Learning By Building. In this project, I am learning how to create an interactive Shiny Dashboard. The data used to create the web app is the **New York City Airbnb Open Data** obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data). This dataset describes the listing activity and metrics in New York City in 2019. All the necessary steps taken before creating the Shiny Dashboard is provided in the **guide.html** and **guide.Rmd** file.
